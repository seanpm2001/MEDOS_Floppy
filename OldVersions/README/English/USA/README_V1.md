# About

See above

Also:

This edition of MEDOS is designed to run on virtual floppy disk files (*.vfd, *.flp) and use them as mountable floppy drives. I will not be supporting a physical version due to the fact that floppy disks are hardly ever used anymore (less than 0.1% of modern computer users still use them)

> Python 3.0 or later

> A source editor (such as notepad++, no other alternates listed)

***

## Devices

MEDOS Floppy Disk edition will not run on actual floppy diskettes, as floppy disk usage is very obscure in 2020 (and even in 2018, when this project was started) virtual machine usage will be the go-to method.

The following virtual machine hypervisors and clients are planned to have support:

> * Oracle VM VirtualBox

> * VMWare

> * Qemu

> * Hyper-V

> * Microsoft Virtual PC 2007

> * Sheepshearer

> * PearPC

> * No other VM Clients/Hypervisors currently listed
